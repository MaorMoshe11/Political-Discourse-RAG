Parliamentary Committee Protocols and Parsing (Vertex AI)

This directory contains the parliamentary committee protocols related to the legislation, along with the code used to parse and preprocess them using Google Vertex AI. 
The protocols correspond to eight committee discussions held during the legislative process.
The parsing pipeline is responsible for transforming raw protocol texts into structured, machine-readable formats suitable for downstream semantic retrieval and discourse analysis.
