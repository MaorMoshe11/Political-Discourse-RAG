This directory contains the parliamentary committee protocols related to the legislation, including both the original PDF files and their OCR-processed text versions. The protocols correspond to eight committee discussions held during the legislative process.

The OCR and text extraction process is implemented using Google Cloud services and is handled by the script pdf_to_txt_by_google_cloud.py. The resulting text outputs are further processed to produce structured, machine-readable representations suitable for downstream semantic retrieval and parliamentary discourse analysis.
